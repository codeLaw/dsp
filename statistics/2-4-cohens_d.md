[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

First babies are slightly lighter (mean = 7.20) than non-first babies (mean = 7.33).  Cohen's d, however, revealed that this difference was only -0.09 standard deviations. Values of .2, .5, and .8 are considered small, medium, and large, respectively.  This small value is similarly small as that derived from the same calculation on mean pregnancy length for the same group comparison (0.029).
