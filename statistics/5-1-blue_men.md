[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

As suggested, I used scipy.stats for this problem.  I used scipy.stats.norm(loc=mu, scale=sigma) (with mu and sigma parameters from the BFRFFS survey), along with the cdf function to determine the percentage of males between 5'10 and 6'1, which was approximately 34.2%.
