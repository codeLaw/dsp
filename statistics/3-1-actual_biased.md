[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

The mean of the actual pmf was 1.02, while the mean of the biased pmf was 2.40.  I used Pmf and BiasPmf (from the book) to obtain the distributions/means as well as thinkplot to plot the data.
